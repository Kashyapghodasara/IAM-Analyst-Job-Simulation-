### Assignment 📝: 
> During this internship simulation, I worked on Identity and Access Management (IAM) tasks for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). My main focus was on creating and applying secure ways to control user access.
> - IAM Solution Design: I built a clear IAM framework that matched the company’s security goals and rules. The solution included Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and the principle of giving users only the minimum access they need (least privilege).

> - Skills Gained: I improved my knowledge of IAM tools, login/authentication methods, cybersecurity best practices, and how to plan security strategies for large organizations.
